      <h2><strong>Inventions and discoveries</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1910:</strong> The Coanda-1910, an experimental aircraft constructed on the principle of air-reactive propulsion.</li>
        <li><strong>1911:</strong> An aircraft powered by two engines driving a single propeller - the configuration cancelled the torque of the engines.</li>
        <li><strong>1926:</strong> Working in Romania, Coanda developed a device to detect liquids under ground, useful in petroleum prospecting. Shortly thereafter, in the Persian Gulf region, he designed a system for offshore oil drilling.</li>
        <li>The most famous of Coanda's discoveries is the Coanda Effect. After more than 20 years studying this phenomenon along with his colleagues, Coanda described what Albert Metral was later to name the <strong>Coanda Effect</strong>. This effect has been utilized in many aeronautical inventions.</li>
        <li>A modular system of sea water desalination and transformation to fresh water, based on solar energy, a clean, ecological and adaptable system.</li>
